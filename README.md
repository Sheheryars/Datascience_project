Netflix Content Analysis with PySpark
Overview
This project utilizes PySpark to analyze the Netflix dataset (netflix_titles.csv). It involves data cleaning, transformation, and insightful analyses to explore trends in Netflix's content library. The workflow includes null value handling, date parsing, categorical analysis, temporal distribution, and numerical duration extraction, enabling a comprehensive understanding of Netflix's content landscape.

Key Features
1. Data Ingestion and Exploration
Loads the dataset and explores its structure using schema inspection and previewing the first few rows.
Verifies the dataset for null values, inconsistencies, and potential errors.
2. Null Value Handling
Replaces missing values in key columns with meaningful defaults, ensuring robust data integrity:
director: "Uncredited"
cast: "Ensemble Cast"
country: "Global"
date_added: "Unspecified"
rating: "Unrated"
release_year: "Undetermined"
title: "Untitled Content"
3. Content Filtering
Filters the dataset to include only valid content types, focusing on 'Movies' and 'TV Shows'.
Removes entries with invalid or null values in critical columns.
4. Date Parsing and Temporal Analysis
Parses the date_added column into a proper date format (MMMM d, yyyy) using Spark's legacy time parsing policy.
Extracts the year from the parsed dates and analyzes the temporal distribution of content additions.
Highlights trends in the number of content additions over the years.
5. Categorical Analysis
Counts the unique categories in key columns such as type, country, rating, and listed_in to assess data diversity.
Provides insights into the variety of content types, genres, and geographical distributions.
6. Numerical Duration Analysis
Extracts numeric values from the duration column using regular expressions.
Computes the average duration of movies (in minutes) to understand typical runtime characteristics.
7. Country-Based Analysis
Identifies the top 5 countries with the highest number of content entries.
Provides a geographical breakdown of Netflix's content library.
8. Descriptive Statistics
Computes and displays descriptive statistics for numerical columns to summarize the dataset.
